#Human Stress Detection Using ANN
This project aims to develop a system for detecting human stress levels using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The system analyzes physiological data, such as heart rate, respiratory rate, and body movements, to classify stress levels. The ANN is trained to differentiate between "Stressed" and "Not Stressed" states, providing a non-invasive method for continuous stress monitoring1. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are evaluated to assess the model's effectiveness.
